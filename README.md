## Project-2-online-library
I got the idea of making this site by looking at different libraries but a few of them having any online accounts. 
But most of them need their memberships. So i came up with a plan to make a library that could be used by anyone 
from a school going kid to elderly people. links:
- Practical and experimental Robotics
- Library banner
- Library logo
- Electronic communication systems
- Timeless steel

Rest of the images of the papers are from my personal computer and papers uploaded are from my personal computer. 
For above and beyond part, I had already made a project using three.js I used that as my background by giving it a z= -1 index 
I was able to incorporate that into my project 2 and used in the index.html page. 
I used different forms to login into the first page form is used in index.html, signup.html and used buttons where ever necessary, 
I have used buttons almost on all the pages.

I have created a  website with the help of
## Tools Used

as the front login page.I got the idea of making this site by looking at different libraries but a few of them having any online accounts,
but most of them need their memberships. So i came up with a plan to make a library that could be used by anyone
from a school going kid to an elderly people. This website consists of seven different pages such as Login Page,
Home Page, eventlist Page and Search Page,â€¨ Forums Page, Podcast Page, Sign Up Page Apart from these pages
