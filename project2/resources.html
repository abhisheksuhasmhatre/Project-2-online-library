		I got the idea of making this site by looking at different libraries but a few of them having any online
		accounts. But most of them need their memberships. So i came up with a plan to make a library that could
		be used by anyone from a school going kid to an old man.

		Rest of the images of the papers are from my personal computer and papers uploaded are from my personal computer.
		For above and beyond part, I had already made a project using three.js I used that as my background by giving it a z= -1 index
		I was able to incorporate that into my project 2 and used in the index.html page. I used different forms to login into the first 
		page form is used in index.html, signup.html and used buttons where ever necessary, I have used buttons almost on all the pages.
